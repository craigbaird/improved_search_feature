# Improved Search Feature

This repository desplays a redesigned search feature which improves the user experience of a web page.

## The Website
The search feature I chose to improve was for I Like You, a Minnesota-themed boutique with locations in Minneapolis and St. Paul. https://i-like-you-minneapolis.myshopify.com/

## The Problem
I set out to find a website that had a search feature, which was bad from a user experience perspective, and improve the search feature. The search feature on I Like You's website was lacking for several reasons:
1. The search feature did not have a predictive text feature to anticipate what a user wanted as they were typing.
2. The search field did not account for misspellings.
3. The search results could not be further narrowed down after the inital search.
4. After searching, there were no suggestions to inspire what the user might look at next. 

## The Solution
I built a static search results page, which if fully implemented would provide additional features and a better user experience for I Like You's 
search result page. These added features improve a user's ability to find what they are looking for quickly, minimizes frustration, and helps a user discover new products they are interested in, based off of their search.
