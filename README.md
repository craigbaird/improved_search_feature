# Improved Search Feature

This repository desplays a redesigned search feature which improves the user experience of a web page.

## The Website
The search feature I chose to improve was for I Like You, a Minnesota-themed boutique with locations in Minneapolis and St. Paul. https://i-like-you-minneapolis.myshopify.com/

## The Problem
I set out to find a website that had a search feature, which was bad from a user experience perspective, and improve the search feature. The search feature on I Like You's website was lacking for several reasons:
1. The search feature did not have a predictive text feature to anticipate what a user wanted as they were typing.
2. The search field did not account for misspellings.
3. The search results could not be further narrowed down after the inital search.
4. After searching, there were no suggestions to inspire what the user might look at next. 

## The Solution
I built a static search results page, which if fully implemented would provide additional features and a better user experience for I Like You's 
search result page. These added features improve a user's ability to find what they are looking for quickly, minimizes frustration, and helps a user discover new products they are interested in, based off of their search. 

## Mockups

The mockups displayed above show my thought process as I was thinking through a solution. Sketches 1, 2, and 4 were not used in the final product. They were part of the process in determining how to arrange the different elements. Sketch 3 highlights the search filter, which lets the user further narrow the results of their search. Sketch 6 highlights the predictive text feature, which generates results based on what the user is typing to help them find what they are looking for more quickly. Sketch 5 highlights the marketing banners, which are displayed below the search results, to show the user other items they may be interested in based off of their search.

## Product Example

### Search Filter

![search_filter](search_filter.png)

The code for the search filter can be viewed in the filter_search_results.html file. The filter is not fully functional, but serves as a representation. The purpose of the search filter is to allow the user to narrow their search results, so that they can find the specific item that they are looking for. In the instance of a search for "shirts", the user would then have the ability to sort the search by tags associated with each item.
